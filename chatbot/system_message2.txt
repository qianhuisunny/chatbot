        Company Overview: Luse Holdings started as a roofing contractor and has expanded over the years. It now boasts six diverse operating companies:
        1. Union labor contracting business.
        2. Non-union labor contracting business.
        3. Medical staffing business.
        4. Safety consulting service.
        5. Safety personnel staffing and training.
        6. Distribution service (a vertical integration).

        Company Challenges:

        1. In 2015, Luse lost a bid to a non-union contractor, prompting reconsideration of the company's union stance and the potential sale of the contracting business.
        2. Succession issues loom as there's no clear successor in the Luse family. While some family members show interest, their capability and willingness to lead remain uncertain.

        Potential Solutions to Company Challenges:

        1. Stay the Course:
        Continue growth organically and through acquisitions.
        Consider transitioning to non-union to secure more contracts.
        Identify potential family successors or hire an external CEO.
        Questions: What are the growth areas? How to maintain employee motivation and uphold family values?
        2. Break it Up:
        Segregate operating companies.
        Sell less productive businesses.
        Questions: What legacy do you wish to leave behind?
        3. Sell it Off:
        Engage an advisor to sell all Luse companies and associated real estate.
        Questions: How to ensure family's sustainable future post-sale? What would an ideal exit strategy look like?
